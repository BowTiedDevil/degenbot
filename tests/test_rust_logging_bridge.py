"""Base-config visibility of Rust-side ``log::`` statements.

The Rust extension emits logs through the ``log`` crate (e.g. ``log::info!`` in
``block_pump.rs`` / ``verify.rs`` / ``register.rs``). ``pyo3-log`` bridges these
into Python's ``logging`` module by forwarding each record to
``logging.getLogger(<rust target with :: -> .>)`` — e.g. a ``log::info!`` in
``degenbot_bot::bot_core::block_pump`` lands on the Python logger named
``degenbot_bot.bot_core.block_pump``.

These tests pin the *base-config* contract: importing ``degenbot`` must, by
itself, make those Rust records visible at INFO without any caller wiring.
